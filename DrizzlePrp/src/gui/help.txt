Welcome to Drizzle!


To use UAM (UruAgeManager):
---------------------------
1) Set the "Pots folder" to wherever you installed PathOfTheShell or CompleteChronicles. (By default it's "C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\Cyan Worlds\Uru - Ages Beyond Myst" or "C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\Cyan Worlds\Myst Uru Complete Chronicles".)
2) Click the "Get Latest Ages" button to get a list of Ages you can download.
3) Select the Age you want, and the latest version and mirror will be chosen for you.
4) Click "Download" to download and install the Age!
5) Make sure one of the Ages you install is "Offline-KI" since that is what lets you link to other Ages.
5) Optional: you can also delete Ages, but you shouldn't ever need to.


To convert Myst 5 Ages the simple way:
--------------------------------------
1) Go to the Simplicity tab, then the MystV tab.
2) Select the folder where you installed Myst 5. (By default, it's "C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Cyan Worlds\Myst V End Of Ages".)
3) Select the folder where you installed PathOfTheShell/CompleteChronicles. (By default it's "C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\Cyan Worlds\Uru - Ages Beyond Myst" or "C:\Program Files\Ubi Soft\Cyan Worlds\Myst Uru Complete Chronicles".)
4) Click the "Start..." button.
5) In the PathOfTheShell/CompleteChronicles folder, run SoundDecompress.exe. (SoundDecompress.exe may crash if you haven't run Uru at least once.)


To use DeepView:
--------------------------
1) Enter the input filename in the first box.  Use a * to include all prps files of an Age.  E.g.: "C:\Pots\dat\Negilahn*"
2) Click the "read" button to read the file(s) into memory.
3) Click the "all types" button to get a list of all the Prp object types found.
4) Explore from there!
5) Optional: If you want to remove all the currently loaded files, click the "clear" button.
6) Optional: If you want to save your changes, select the folder to save them to in the second box.  Then click the "save changes" button.


To run the proxy server:
------------------------
1) Put all the zip files (or folders, if that's what you're using) into some folder together, including "index.net.zip".
2) Start Drizzle and go to the Proxy tab.
3) Set the base folder to the folder you put all the zip files in.
4) Optional: set the port(default 8012) and whether you want it to log when it successfully reads a file.
5) Click the start button.
6) Set the proxy in your browser to 127.0.0.1:8012 (In firefox 3, go to Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Connection Settings.  Select "Manual proxy configuration" and check "uses this proxy server for all protocols".  Set "Http proxy" to "127.0.0.1" and "Port" to "8012".)
7) Optional: install an add-on like QuickProxy to firefox, so you can quickly switch between proxy mode and not.
8) Go to http://index.net to start browsing.
