Welcome to Drizzle!


To run the proxy server:
------------------------
1) Put all the zip files (or folders, if that's what you're using) into some folder together, including "index.net.zip".
2) Start Drizzle and go to the Proxy tab.
3) Set the base folder to the folder you put all the zip files in.
4) Optional: set the port(default 8012) and whether you want it to log when it successfully reads a file.
5) Click the start button.
6) Set the proxy in your browser to 127.0.0.1:8012 (In firefox 3, go to Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Connection Settings.  Select "Manual proxy configuration" and check "uses this proxy server for all protocols".  Set "Http proxy" to "127.0.0.1" and "Port" to "8012".)
7) Optional: install an add-on like QuickProxy to firefox, so you can quickly switch between proxy mode and not.
8) Go to http://index.net to start browsing.
