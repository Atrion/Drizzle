The bouncycastle.org license can be found in each package's folder as LICENSE.html
The jetty license is LGPL/GPL/Apache2.0/X11-like
  The readme files say that the javax.servlet classes are CDDL1.0, but Sun has also made them GPLv2+classpathException.
  Consequently all licenses are compatible(the classpath exception allows us to make this project GPLv3+ even though the javax.servlet classes are GPLv2). 
The apache commons-math license is Apache2.0
The SevenZip stuff license is LGPL
All other files are GPLv3 or later, as noted at the start of each file.
